# Ghostty minimized fuzz corpora

The files in `osc-cmin/`, `parser-cmin/`, and `stream-cmin/` are copied
verbatim from Ghostty revision `88b4cd047fa627cdca6781bc7e7dc8b75a2cecb9`.
They are the AFL++ edge-minimized corpora described in `README.upstream.md`.
See `LICENSE.upstream` (MIT).

The adapter preserves the upstream harness semantics: parser members are raw
VT input, stream members discard their first path-selector byte, and OSC
members use their first byte to select BEL, ST, or a missing terminator. Each
member is fed whole and across deterministic parser boundaries. The oracle
compares all externally observable streams and modes plus Zutty's rich model
state; full cell records remain available for exact mismatch diagnostics.
